# Markowitz Portfolio Stress Testing

This project builds a minimum variance portfolio using FTSE MIB and VSTOXX data. It estimates daily Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) using rolling covariance and backtests model performance from 2010â€“2025. Stress scenarios are simulated by amplifying volatility to assess risk under extreme conditions. The model is implemented in Python using pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and yfinance. Key plots and a LaTeX report are included for academic submission.
